#Types of Authentication Factors

This section covers the different types of authentication factors that are available and their security considerations. Each type if divided into the following categories:

### 🔢 Single and Multi Factor OTP Devices

🟢 **Definition:**

-   Single factor One time Password (OTP) devices are physical devices that generate OTPs
-   Multi factor OTP devices are similar to single factor OTP device but they must be activated by either something you know or something you are or both

🟡 **Example:** The OTP is displayed on the device and manually input for transmission to the verifier, thereby proving possession and control of the device. An OTP device may, for example, display 6 characters at a time.

### 🔑 Single and Multi Factor Cryptographic Device and Software

🟢 **Definitions:**

-   A single-factor cryptographic device is a hardware device that performs cryptographic operations using protected cryptographic key(s) and provides the authenticator output via direct connection to the user endpoint
-   A Multi-factor cryptographic device is similar to single-factor cryptographic device but it must be activated by either something you know or something you are or both.
-   A single-factor cryptographic software is a cryptographic key stored on disk or some other "soft" media. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key
-   A Multi-factor cryptographic software is similar to single-factor cryptographic software but it must be activated by either something you know or something you are or both.

🟡 **Examples:**

-   Single/Multi-factor cryptographic device:

    -   USB authenticator such as a YubiKey or Google Titan
    -   Smart cards with an embedded processor

-   Single/Multi-factor cryptographic software:

    -   Use of a client X.509 certificate

### 🧬 Biometric

🟢 **Definition:** The use of biometrics in authentication includes both measurement of physical characteristics and behavioral characteristics of a user

🟡 **Example:**

-   Facial recognition
-   Finger print scan
-   Iris scan
-   Typing cadence
